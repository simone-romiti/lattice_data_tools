This folder contains plotting routines for frequent plots in lattice calculations.
At the moment, these are the libraries used:

- [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/): for html plots. _Drawback_: Mathjax support is buggy.
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/): for pdf plots. _Drawback_: cannot save in html
- [`plotnine`]((https://plotnine.org/)): just for experimental purposes
