This is the documentation of the software library hosted at [this repostory](https://github.com/simone-romiti/nested_sampling).

# Things to be done

- Routines for the extrapolation to the physical point using F_\pi. References:
    * Eq. 16 and 17 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4504
    * FVE: Eq. 31 and 32 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0847 for the R factors of eq. 16 and 25.
- Generate the documentation for the already written code. 
- Write some theoretical notes on Nested Sampling
