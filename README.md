This repository contains scripts in `python` (and a few in `R`) for the analysis of lattice data.

**Documentation**: 
Each subfolder contains a README.md summarizing some information on what the modules do. Please refer to the docstrings for further information.

**Tests**:
In the `./test/` folder there are scripts testing the routines of the library. 
They should be run from that directory.

**TODO**:
- Routines for the extrapolation to the physical point using F_\pi. References:
    * Eq. 16 and 17 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4504
    * FVE: Eq. 31 and 32 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0847 for the R factors of eq. 16 and 25.
